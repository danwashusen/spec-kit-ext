```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Load Spec Kit configuration (`/.specify.yaml` if present, otherwise `/config-default.yaml`) and extract the root `spec-kit` entry as `SPEC_KIT_CONFIG`. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     * Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     * Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:
     ```
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```
   - Calculate overall status:
     * **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     * **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     * Display the table with incomplete item counts
     * **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     * Wait for user response before continuing
     * If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     * If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     * Display the table showing all checklists passed
     * Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Review the Implementation Log (if `tasks.md` contains `## Implementation Log`):
   - Parse the entire section before doing any new work; treat entries as newest-first history.
   - Summarize outstanding follow-ups, open questions, or paused work noted in the log.
   - If the section is missing or empty, warn and plan to create/populate it when the first task completes.

4. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
   - If defined, load each `SPEC_KIT_CONFIG.implement.documents[*]` (resolve relative to repo root) and treat the `context` as authoritative guidance. Read the changelog at `SPEC_KIT_CONFIG.changelog.path` (if present) and re-read the constitution via `SPEC_KIT_CONFIG.constitution.path` to enforce all principles. Treat these documents as read-only and note missing files without failing.

5. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:
   
   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```
   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore
   
   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology
   
   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
   
   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`

6. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

7. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding
   - **Deliver full task scope**: Each task must be implemented completely as written—no deferrals of core functionality unless explicitly approved by the user.
   - **Sandbox restrictions**: If the execution environment blocks a required action (e.g., installing dependencies, accessing network resources), pause immediately, report the restriction, and request guidance instead of attempting workarounds.
   - **Assumption handling**:
     * Prefix any assumption you surface with `[ASSUMPTION]` in your output.
     * Only proceed with an assumption when the alternative is inaction; otherwise request clarification from the user.
     * Record the rationale in an "Assumption Log" appended to `tasks.md` near the affected task.
   - **Plan deviations**:
     * Prefix any deviation with `[PLAN DEVIATION]`.
     * Halt and consult the user before changing task scope or deferring required deliverables.
     * Document user-approved deviations in `research.md` under a new "Implementation Decisions" subsection.
   - **Code quality gates**: Run linting, formatting, type-checking, and unit tests as prescribed by the plan within each phase.

8. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

9. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file and record a log entry under `## Implementation Log` with:
     - Timestamp in ISO 8601 format
     - Task ID and short description of the work performed
     - Key files touched, commands executed, and validations/tests run
     - Any follow-ups, open questions, or context needed for future runs
     - Insert the new entry at the top so the newest items appear first
     - Create the section if missing and keep a single header with consolidated entries

10. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.
