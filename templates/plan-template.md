# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Codebase Reconnaissance

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Summarize exhaustive findings from Phase 0 reconnaissance.
  Use Story IDs from spec.md (US1, US2, ...) and Decision IDs (D001, D002, ...)
  to keep entries aligned with research.md. Add subsections per story when
  helpful (e.g., ### US1 – Story name).
-->

| Story/Decision | File/Directory | Role Today | Helpers/Configs | Risks & Follow-up | Verification Hooks |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| D001 / US1     | /path/to/file  | [current behavior/responsibility] | [related utils, feature flags, env vars] | [edge cases, TODO owners] | [tests, commands, scripts] |

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Update agent context**:
   - Run the agent-specific context script to record new technologies introduced in this plan
   - Append only new information; preserve existing manual notes

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated agent context file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the `/speckit.tasks` command will do - DO NOT execute during `/speckit.plan`*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Organize tasks by user story priority (P1, P2, P3...)
- Each user story → complete set of tests (if requested), models, services, endpoints, and integration work
- Shared setup and foundational tasks appear before user stories; polish tasks appear last
- Use `[P]` markers for parallel-safe tasks (different files)

**Outputs expected from `/speckit.tasks`**:
- `tasks.md` with phases for setup, foundational work, each user story, and polish
- MVP recommendation and dependency graph between user stories
- Parallel execution guidance and implementation strategy summary
